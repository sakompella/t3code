 * Thin CLI entry.

 * Every ACP agent spawns `t3 acp-mcp-bridge` while opening its session, and
 * terminal-fallback agents run `t3 acp-mcp-call` per tool call, so their
 * startup sits on first-message latency. Both dispatch here before the full
 * CLI module graph (seconds of evaluation) loads; everything else defers to
 * the real CLI in ./binCli.ts.
